                        <p>Banned Books Week is over, but for anti-censorship advocates, combatting the ongoing surge of attempts to restrict access to certain books in public spaces may be a years-long endeavor.</p>
                        <p>Close to 4,000 titles were challenged during the first eight months of 2023, according to the American Library Association, yet only 531 individuals and groups initiated those challenges. In other words, the persistent -- and often collective -- work of just a few has resulted in the highest number of reported censorship attempts in decades.</p>
                        <p>"People want ideas consistent with what they believe," Harvard professor and author Imani Perry told an audience at a panel event focused on censorship earlier this month. "The larger question, though, is what does it mean not to be willing to have one's ideas contested." </p>
                        <p>While some reject efforts to ban reading materials, here are the top three groups that are pushing those same efforts forward:</p>
