                        <p>Banned Books Week has ended, but efforts to prevent the censorship of reading materials at public schools and libraries continue. </p>
                        <p>Librarians, teachers and other anti-censorship advocates have spent more than a year combatting an ongoing surge in attempts to remove or restrict access to books, displays and services from public spaces. Preliminary data recently published by the American Library Association shows their work may be far from over: Between January and August, there have been a precedent-setting 695 individual attempts to ban reading materials.</p>
                        <p>"People want ideas consistent with what they believe," Harvard professor and author Imani Perry told an audience at a panel event focused on censorship last week. "The larger question, though, is what does it mean not to be willing to have one's ideas contested." </p>
                        <p>While Banned Books Week rejects efforts to ban reading materials, here are the top three groups pushing those same efforts forward:</p>

The association notes that parents have historically acted individually to challenge books at their children's schools.
